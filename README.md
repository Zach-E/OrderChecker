Block Diagrams for Computer Engineering project

Includes final report where each part of the project is explained. The project was made on an FPGA machine with switches, push buttons, seven segment decoders, and LEDs. The project was my final project for CprE 281. It is a machine that can load in numbers into a register, using switches as an input for binary numbers. The machine then can be switched to a checking state. During the checking state, the machine makes sure the numbers are in inreasing order throughout the registers. If a problem is detected, a LED indicating which register has the problem lights up.
